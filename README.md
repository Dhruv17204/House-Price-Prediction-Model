# House-Price-Prediction-Model
This project presents a machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes. It leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation techniques to build an accurate predictive model.
